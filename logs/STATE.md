**Updated:** 2026-08-19 · branch `main` · after the causal-depth runtime repair

# Current state

The **human view of [`current_state.json`](current_state.json)**. That file owns
the live facts; this one says the same things in prose and adds nothing it does
not carry. If the two disagree, a structural test fails.

**Nothing is running. Nothing is billing. Nothing is authorized. Nothing is
prepared for launch.**

Phase-A attempt 10 ran 2026-08-18/19 and was **stopped on maintainer
instruction**: Stage 0 passed, Stage 1's third operator expansion ran 10 h 47 m
without finishing while the paid L40S sat at 0-1 %. **$11.43, incomplete,
operator runtime-cost failure — not a scientific result and not a Stage-1
selection result.**

## Budget

```
cumulative spend   $206.0130
approved cap       $219.00
remaining          $12.9870   NOT permission

**$12.9870 is not enough for another full Phase-A attempt** at the $23.0484
per-launch ceiling. A retry requires a separate budget/cap decision after the
runtime fix is reviewed. Stopping attempt 10 early preserved ~$11.6 of the
ceiling it was authorized to spend.
```

Every authorization issued is **consumed** — each one's lineage gate refuses the
current HEAD by construction. A new paid action needs a new artifact. Detail in
[`BUDGET_LEDGER.md`](BUDGET_LEDGER.md).

Also frozen: recovery design, selection rules, pooled_counts@v2, Stage-3 artifacts and thresholds, the operator ledger's declared semantics.

## Complete

* Stage 3 (both permanent controls, thresholds materialized)
* the Phase-A harness, stages 0-5 executing for real at $0
* the Stage-1 device audit (autoinit.stage1_device_contract@v1)
* Stage 0 on hardware, passed four times — latest attempt 9, attesting
  protocol `250f72ef`, identity `70a26e0b`, science plan `02be33b9`

## Latest verification

After correcting the causal-depth GPU measurement job. CPU only — no checkpoint
loaded, no metric measured, no GPU used:

* full suite **1906 passed, 11 skipped, 0 errors** in 16:57.
* pod simulator **1866 passed, 22 skipped**; artifact tree restored **exactly** —
  1623 entries.
* frozen-asset verifier **passed**; the CPU equivalence artifact still passes and
  is retained as the independent proof on argmin, tie-break and cache semantics.

## What failed, and why

All five are the same two classes, and both are now closed by construction:
GPU-only device code (fixed by `autoinit.stage1_device_contract@v1`) and a
contract owned by inherited machinery (fixed by the session specification).

| run | cost | died at | cause |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Phase A 1-5 | $1.6321 | setup / stage 0 | five distinct fail-closed gates; all fixed |
| Phase A 6 | $0.3552 | stage 1 | _validate probe on config.device, child on the host |
| Phase A 7 | $0.3955 | stage 1 | ActivationStatsCollector accumulators unplaced |
| canary 1 | $0.0603 | before setup | wrapper missing 3 inherited self.a attributes |
| canary 2 | $0.0637 | in setup | wrapper set LOCAL_ASSETS = (); shared setup copies them |
| Phase A 8 | $0.1900 | setup / test gate | two dev-box-environment tests that cannot pass in a container |
| Phase A 9 | $0.3400 | stage 1 | `stream_projection`'s `avg` allocated with no device (`project.py:57`) |
| Phase A 10 | $11.4300 | stage 1, 3rd expansion | `depth.causal_kl_greedy_v1`: 260×67 full-vocabulary softmax/KL **on the CPU**, unbounded and unpriced |

**The pattern, through attempt 7:** code no $0 path could execute — a GPU-only
device, or a contract owned by inherited machinery. **Attempt 8 is a new
pattern:** a $0 path that *does* run on the dev box and asserts **dev-box
filesystem state**, so the pod simulator passes it for the wrong reason.
Details in [`autoinit_phase_a_attempt8/`](autoinit_phase_a_attempt8/). Twice the symptom was generalized
instead of the cause, and it was paid for twice. Full diagnoses in
[`decisions.md`](decisions.md); per-run evidence in the directories
[`CATALOG.md`](CATALOG.md) lists.

## Canonical infrastructure

* **the session specification**: one immutable `SessionSpec` per session, one
  runner, no inheritance and no module-global retargeting
  ([`../docs/SESSION_ARCHITECTURE.md`](../docs/SESSION_ARCHITECTURE.md))
* the shared pod setup is manifest-driven on **both** sides: it installs the
  local assets a session declares and stages the relay science inputs a session
  declares, and names no asset, relay path, destination or digest of its own.
  `RelayInput` carries source, destination, digest and mirror; `dest=None` means
  only "the driver stages this", never "the shell knows"
* the layout test partitions its references: repository-relative paths must
  exist, declared host-local storage roots are verified where present and
  **skipped where absent**, and an undeclared absolute path still fails
* an active tombstone may not name a declared session staging or mirror
  destination — checked against the four `SessionSpec`s, touching no path, so the
  dev box, the simulator and a pod all give the same answer
* `checkpoint_tombstones.json` owns the active-tombstone counts and bytes
* the Phase-A authorization schema carries no grant; the issuer requires one
* autoinit.stage1_device_contract@v1, **category 5 added 2026-08-19**: a fresh
  tensor factory on the Stage-1 path either names a device derived from what it
  meets, or is host-only on purpose and must not be mechanically moved
* placement asserted by intercepting factory calls
  (`tests/autoinit/factory_placement.py`) — the dual of the `HostCacheTensor`
  split; neither instrument can see the other's class
* full tracebacks for unexpected in-process driver exceptions
* plan_session soft_stop_reserves, applied BEFORE the soft stop
* the pre-flight rehearsal ignored in both the pod gate and the simulator, with the ignore lists pinned equal
* the pod simulator restores exactly and refuses concurrent sweeps

## Abandoned / terminated — do not revive

* recovery_search_v1 (INVALID before first use)
* Phase-A pricing bases $20.0126 and $22.4508
* student-prefix recovery (E5)
* any fourth seed
* the paid device-canary session path: STRATEGICALLY TERMINATED 2026-08-18. Two authorized sessions, $0.1240, zero canary runs; both died in the wrapper's inherited contracts. Its evidence and its generic lesson are kept; no further canary is prepared.

## Next starting point

**The measurement job had three material defects and they were found before it
cost anything.** It timed every sample at cardinality 8 (overstating
evaluations/min, since larger skip sets run *fewer* layers); it built its own
reference cache, bypassing the operator's 0.66 gate and recompute fallback; and
it accepted an unpinned Hub revision. A fourth was mine — the docstring claimed
GPU utilization it never sampled. All four are fixed and mutation-verified.

**A finding that reshaped the comparison:** E8a merges a subtype's raw sums and
normalizes once (position-weighted), while the operator normalizes per item and
takes an unweighted mean — its own declared semantics. On unequal-length items
these differ by **~0.027, about 300× the smallest decision margin (8.195e-05)**.
A naive E8a-vs-port *score* comparison would have reported that as catastrophic
drift. The paired check is therefore **per-item**, where the two must agree
exactly, with the aggregation gap reported separately and marked expected.

**Nothing is authorized.** The ask is **one short L40S measurement**, hard ceiling
**$1.6294** (expected $0.5431) — 12.5% of the remaining $12.9870. No search, no
depth map, no checkpoint. It would settle: the repaired port's evaluations/min
against E8a's 12.0, real peak VRAM and the cache decision, per-item E8a-vs-port
equality on one accelerator, and sampled GPU utilization against attempt 10's
0–1%.

**Only after those measured values exist** should Stage 1 be repriced and a full
Phase-A attempt considered. Attempt 11 is not the next step.
