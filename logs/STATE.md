# Current state

The **human view of [`current_state.json`](current_state.json)**. That file owns
the live facts; this one says the same things in prose and adds nothing it does
not carry. If the two disagree, a structural test fails.

**Nothing is running. Nothing is billing. Nothing is authorized. Nothing is
prepared for launch.**

## Budget

```
cumulative spend   $194.2430
approved cap       $219.00
remaining          $24.7570   NOT permission
```

Every authorization issued is **consumed** — each one's lineage gate refuses the
current HEAD by construction. A new paid action needs a new artifact. Detail in
[`BUDGET_LEDGER.md`](BUDGET_LEDGER.md).

Also frozen: recovery design, selection rules, pooled_counts@v2, Stage-3 artifacts and thresholds, the operator ledger's declared semantics.

## Complete

* Stage 3 (both permanent controls, thresholds materialized)
* the Phase-A harness, stages 0-5 executing for real at $0
* the Stage-1 device audit (autoinit.stage1_device_contract@v1)
* Stage 0 on hardware, passed three times

## Latest verification

After the $0 fix for the two assertions that failed Phase-A attempt 8's setup
test gate. CPU only — no checkpoint was loaded and no metric measured:

* full suite **1874 passed, 11 skipped, 0 errors** in 19:32.
* pod simulator **1834 passed, 22 skipped**; artifact tree restored **exactly**
  — 1598 entries, identical type/size/path before and after.
* focused docs/storage/session **395 passed, 5 skipped**.
* frozen-asset verifier **passed**, no problems.
* Phase-A pricing reproduces **$17.8933 / $22.7183 / $23.0483** exactly, reserves
  at 147.7683 and 36.2158 min.
* **the pod's own condition reproduced**: with `artifacts/stage3/ladder_uniform`
  present, `test_no_tombstoned_path_is_still_on_disk` now passes. The directory
  was removed again afterwards.

## What failed, and why

All five are the same two classes, and both are now closed by construction:
GPU-only device code (fixed by `autoinit.stage1_device_contract@v1`) and a
contract owned by inherited machinery (fixed by the session specification).

| run | cost | died at | cause |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Phase A 1-5 | $1.6321 | setup / stage 0 | five distinct fail-closed gates; all fixed |
| Phase A 6 | $0.3552 | stage 1 | _validate probe on config.device, child on the host |
| Phase A 7 | $0.3955 | stage 1 | ActivationStatsCollector accumulators unplaced |
| canary 1 | $0.0603 | before setup | wrapper missing 3 inherited self.a attributes |
| canary 2 | $0.0637 | in setup | wrapper set LOCAL_ASSETS = (); shared setup copies them |
| Phase A 8 | $0.1900 | setup / test gate | two dev-box-environment tests that cannot pass in a container |

**The pattern, through attempt 7:** code no $0 path could execute — a GPU-only
device, or a contract owned by inherited machinery. **Attempt 8 is a new
pattern:** a $0 path that *does* run on the dev box and asserts **dev-box
filesystem state**, so the pod simulator passes it for the wrong reason.
Details in [`autoinit_phase_a_attempt8/`](autoinit_phase_a_attempt8/). Twice the symptom was generalized
instead of the cause, and it was paid for twice. Full diagnoses in
[`decisions.md`](decisions.md); per-run evidence in the directories
[`CATALOG.md`](CATALOG.md) lists.

## Canonical infrastructure

* **the session specification**: one immutable `SessionSpec` per session, one
  runner, no inheritance and no module-global retargeting
  ([`../docs/SESSION_ARCHITECTURE.md`](../docs/SESSION_ARCHITECTURE.md))
* the shared pod setup is manifest-driven on **both** sides: it installs the
  local assets a session declares and stages the relay science inputs a session
  declares, and names no asset, relay path, destination or digest of its own.
  `RelayInput` carries source, destination, digest and mirror; `dest=None` means
  only "the driver stages this", never "the shell knows"
* the layout test partitions its references: repository-relative paths must
  exist, declared host-local storage roots are verified where present and
  **skipped where absent**, and an undeclared absolute path still fails
* an active tombstone may not name a declared session staging or mirror
  destination — checked against the four `SessionSpec`s, touching no path, so the
  dev box, the simulator and a pod all give the same answer
* `checkpoint_tombstones.json` owns the active-tombstone counts and bytes
* the Phase-A authorization schema carries no grant; the issuer requires one
* autoinit.stage1_device_contract@v1
* full tracebacks for unexpected in-process driver exceptions
* plan_session soft_stop_reserves, applied BEFORE the soft stop
* the pre-flight rehearsal ignored in both the pod gate and the simulator, with the ignore lists pinned equal
* the pod simulator restores exactly and refuses concurrent sweeps

## Abandoned / terminated — do not revive

* recovery_search_v1 (INVALID before first use)
* Phase-A pricing bases $20.0126 and $22.4508
* student-prefix recovery (E5)
* any fourth seed
* the paid device-canary session path: STRATEGICALLY TERMINATED 2026-08-18. Two authorized sessions, $0.1240, zero canary runs; both died in the wrapper's inherited contracts. Its evidence and its generic lesson are kept; no further canary is prepared.

## Next starting point

**The two attempt-8 assertions are fixed and verified at $0.** `REPO_LAYOUT.md`
still names the real external storage paths; the layout test no longer demands
that every execution environment be the maintainer's machine.
`stage3_ladder_uniform_local_cache` is **withdrawn** — the deletion stands, the
per-file hashes stand, and the entry no longer asserts that a routine staging
destination is retired. Active tombstones: **16 / 3.6406 GiB**, against the
**7 units / 3.660 GiB** the cleanup physically removed; both figures are true and
neither corrects the other.

**Nothing is authorized, funded or prepared.** Attempt 8's grant covered one
launch, is spent, and its lineage gate refuses the current HEAD.

The next decision is **Phase-A attempt 9**, under a new one-use grant and the
normal chain: **write a grant document** -> pre-auth base commit -> issue against
that grant -> authorization-only commit -> bundle upload -> round-trip verify ->
launch. No canary and no further readiness phase is required.
