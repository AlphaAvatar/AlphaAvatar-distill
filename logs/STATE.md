**Updated:** 2026-08-18 · branch `main` · structural baseline

# Current state

The **human view of [`current_state.json`](current_state.json)**. That file owns
the live facts; this one says the same things in prose and adds nothing it does
not carry. If the two disagree, a structural test fails.

**Nothing is running. Nothing is billing. Nothing is authorized. Nothing is
prepared for launch.**

## Budget

```
cumulative spend   $194.0530
approved cap       $219.00
remaining          $24.9470   NOT permission
```

Every authorization issued is **consumed** — each one's lineage gate refuses the
current HEAD by construction. A new paid action needs a new artifact. Detail in
[`BUDGET_LEDGER.md`](BUDGET_LEDGER.md).

Also frozen: recovery design, selection rules, pooled_counts@v2, Stage-3 artifacts and thresholds, the operator ledger's declared semantics.

## Complete

* Stage 3 (both permanent controls, thresholds materialized)
* the Phase-A harness, stages 0-5 executing for real at $0
* the Stage-1 device audit (autoinit.stage1_device_contract@v1)
* Stage 0 on hardware, passed three times

## What failed, and why

| run | cost | died at | cause |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Phase A 1-5 | $1.6321 | setup / stage 0 | five distinct fail-closed gates; all fixed |
| Phase A 6 | $0.3552 | stage 1 | _validate probe on config.device, child on the host |
| Phase A 7 | $0.3955 | stage 1 | ActivationStatsCollector accumulators unplaced |
| canary 1 | $0.0603 | before setup | wrapper missing 3 inherited self.a attributes |
| canary 2 | $0.0637 | in setup | wrapper set LOCAL_ASSETS = (); shared setup copies them |

**The pattern:** every one was code no $0 path could execute: a GPU-only device, or a contract owned by inherited machinery. Twice the symptom was generalized
instead of the cause, and it was paid for twice. Full diagnoses in
[`decisions.md`](decisions.md); per-run evidence in the directories
[`CATALOG.md`](CATALOG.md) lists.

## Canonical infrastructure

* autoinit.stage1_device_contract@v1
* full tracebacks for unexpected in-process driver exceptions
* plan_session soft_stop_reserves, applied BEFORE the soft stop
* the pre-flight rehearsal ignored in both the pod gate and the simulator, with the ignore lists pinned equal
* the pod simulator restores exactly and refuses concurrent sweeps

## Abandoned / terminated — do not revive

* recovery_search_v1 (INVALID before first use)
* Phase-A pricing bases $20.0126 and $22.4508
* student-prefix recovery (E5)
* any fourth seed
* the paid device-canary session path: STRATEGICALLY TERMINATED 2026-08-18. Two authorized sessions, $0.1240, zero canary runs; both died in the wrapper's inherited contracts. Its evidence and its generic lesson are kept; no further canary is prepared.

## Next starting point

Three options, **none authorized and none prepared**. The maintainer chooses.

1. **implement the SPECIFIED session architecture in docs/SESSION_ARCHITECTURE.md, in the order it lists. Zero cost. It removes the defect class that has cost three paid pods, and steps 1-2 are a valid stopping point because the Phase-A price reproducing exactly is the proof the transformation preserved behaviour.**
2. fix the canary wrapper (declare LOCAL_ASSETS as the other sessions do) and enumerate the WHOLE inherited contract before launching; $1.0197 hard. Note that the architecture work in option 1 is what makes that enumeration mechanical rather than a matter of remembering.
3. skip the canary and go to Attempt 8; Phase A exercises the same operators on CUDA anyway and stage-1 failures now come home with a traceback; $23.0484 hard.

Either paid option requires a fresh authorization chain: pre-auth base commit -> issue -> auth-only commit -> bundle upload -> round-trip verify -> launch.
